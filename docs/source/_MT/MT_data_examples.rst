MT software on Raijin
=========================

In order to use the Raijin MT software, let's first login to Raijin::

  $ ssh abc123@raijin.nci.org.au

where ``abc123`` is your NCI username.

Now use a text editor (e.g. nano, emacs, vi) to edit your ``.bashrc``::

  $ nano ~/.bashrc

Add the following line to the bottom of your ``.bashrc``::

  $ export MODULEPATH=/g/data/my80/apps/modules/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH

Save and exit.

Run the following command in your terminal::

  $ source ~/.bashrc

You should now be able to load the following MT modules::

  $ module load birrp

  $ module load occam1DCSEM

  $ module load dipole1D

  $ module load occam2D

  $ module load mare2DEM

  $ module load modem

Once these modules are loaded, to run **BIRRP**::

  $ birrp-5.3.2

To test that **BIRRP** is working::

  $ cd /g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test

  $ birrp-5.3.2 < CP1_LP_NR.script

To run **OCCAM1DCSEM** and/or **DIPOLE1D**::

  $ occam1DCSEM

To test **OCCAM1DCSEM** is working::

  $ cd /g/data/my80/sandbox/occam_test/occam1DCSEM/Canonical_RealImag_BxEyEz

  $ occam1DCSEM startup


To run **mare2DEM**, we first need to load in the intel-mpi module::

  $ module load intel-mpi

To run **mare2DEM** in inversion mode::

  $ mpirun -np <number of processors> mare2DEM <input resistivity file>

To run **mare2DEM** in forward mode::

  $ mpirun -np <number of processors> mare2DEM -F <input resistivity file>

To run **mare2DEM** in forward fields mode::

  $ mpirun -np <number of processors> mare2DEM -FF <input resistivity file>

To test **mare2DEM** is working::

  $ mpirun -np 8 mare2DEM Demo.0.resistivity


To run **OCCAM2D**::

  $ Occam2D

To test **OCCAM2D** is working::

  $ cd /g/data/my80/sandbox/occam_test/Test2

  $ Occam2D startup

To run **ModEM**::

  $ mod2DMT

  or

  $ mod3DMT

**Note:** If you need to use the **Mod3DMT_MPI** parallel code, you will have join the group **ModEM-geophys** via the NCI `Mancini page`_

.. _Mancini page: https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/login?next=/mancini/



Once you have access to this group, you can load in the following module::

  $ module load ModEM-geophysics/2013.06

MT software on the NCI Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
============================================================

.. _VDI user guide: https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/VDI+User+Guide

We can also access the MT software on the VDI. Once logged in to the VDI via Strudel (see the `VDI user guide`_ for installation instructions),
open up a terminal and use a text editor (e.g. nano, emacs, vi) to edit your bashrc::

  $ nano ~/.bashrc

Add the following line to the bottom of your bashrc::

  $ export MODULEPATH=/g/data3/my80/apps/modules/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH

Save and exit.

Run the following command in the terminal::

  $ source ~/.bashrc

Now you should be able to load in the following modules::

  $ module load birrp

  $ module load occam1DCSEM

  $ module load dipole1D

  $ module load occam2D

  $ module load mare2DEM

  $ module load modem

  $ module load snuffler

**BIRRP**, **OCCAM**, **mare2DEM** and **ModEM** can be used as per the instructions for Raijin.

To run snuffler::

  $ snuffler


Time-series QC using snuffler, a miniSEED time-series visualisation tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

:blue:`The Snuffler is an interactive and extensible seismogram browser (but can also be used to view MT time-series) that is suited for small and very big datasets and archives.`\


For more information about Snuffler, please visit the `Snuffler manual`_

.. _Snuffler manual: https://pyrocko.org/v0.3/apps_snuffler.html


For this example, we need to first log into NCI's VDI. Once on the VDI, open up a terminal.

Let's load in the module snuffler::

  $ module load snuffler

For this example, let's view some miniSEED data located here::

  $ cd /g/data/my80/sandbox/snuffler_test/

To view this example time series::

  $ snuffler *.mseed

and the following window should open:

.. image:: ../_static/images/Snuffler1.png

Initially there are no waveforms. To zoom in and view the waveforms, hold the mouse over the coloured boxes and pull towards you. Once you zoom in close enough, the time-series will appear. To zoom out, hold the mouse over the trace data and push the mouse away from you.

.. image:: ../_static/images/Snuffler2.png

Navigation commands:

**< space >** - move forward one page in time

**b** - move backward one page in time

**f** - full screen is displayed

**< minus >** - remove one trace from the snuffler screen

**< plus >** - add a trace to the snuffler screen

**:** - toggle the snuffler command line

**?** - displays help information

Running the Bounded Influence, Remote Reference Processing (BIRRP) code on NCI's VDI and Raijin
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once we are happy with the quality of our time-series, the next step is to run our time-series data processing. For this example, we will run the Bounded Influence, Remote Reference Processing (BIRRP) code of A.D. Chave and D.J. Thomsom.

For those unfamiliar, the BIRRP program computes magnetotelluric and geomagnetic depth sounding response functions using a bounded influence, remote reference method, along with an implementation of the jackknife to get error estimates on the result. It incorporates a method for controlling leverage points (i.e., magnetic field values which are statistically anomalous), includes the implementation of two stage processing which enables removal of outliers in both the local electric and magnetic field variables, and allows multiple remote reference sites to be used.

For more information about BIRRP and links to the relevant literature, please visit `here`__

Using BIRRP on the VDI
+++++++++++++++++++++++

A test dataset has been created with 16 MT sites and associated E/B time-series ready for BIRRP processing. Note that this test is mainly focusing on computational performance and not on the results of the BIRRP processing.

BIRRP script files for sites B1-B16 can be found here::

  $ cd /g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/

For example::

  $ less B1/CP1.script

Let's create a file with a simple loop to run BIRRP processing serially (one station after another) on each of our 16 MT sites. Run::

  $ less serial_VDI.sh


to view the following script::

  #!/bin/bash

  for f in /g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/B*;
    do
      [ -d $f ] && cd "$f" && echo Entering into $f and running BIRRP && birrp-5.3.2 < CP1.script && cd ..
    done;

To run this script::

  source serial_VDI.sh

  The job execution time for this script is approximately 30 minutes.


Now let's slightly edit our script to run the 16 BIRRP executions in parallel using the 8 cores available on the VDI. Run::

  $ less parallel_VDI.sh

to view the following script::

  #!/bin/bash

  for f in /g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/B*;
    do
       [ -d $f ] && cd "$f" && echo Entering into $f and running BIRRP && birrp-5.3.2 < CP1.script && cd .. &

    done
    wait

To run this script::

  $ source parallel_VDI.sh

The job execution time for this script is approximately 4 minutes.

Using BIRRP on Raijin
++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's test our BIRRP processing script on Raijin using 16 cpus and 500MB of memory.

Login to raijin and run::

  $ cd /g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/

  $ less parallel_VDI.sh

to view the following script::

  #!/bin/bash

  #PBS -P z00
  #PBS -q normal
  #PBS -l walltime=00:05:00
  #PBS -l mem=500MB
  #PBS -l jobfs=1GB
  #PBS -l ncpus=16
  #PBS -l software=birrp-5.3.2
  #PBS -l wd

  module purge
  module load birrp/5.3.2

  for f in /g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/B*;
    do
       [ -d $f ] && cd "$f" && echo Entering into $f and running BIRRP && birrp-5.3.2 < CP1.script && cd .. &

    done
    wait

To run this script::

  $ source parallel_raijin.sh

The job execution time for this script is approximately 1 minute.

Here we can see that by running our BIRRP loop on Raijin using multiple CPUs, we can significantly decrease our processing time. In theory we could run thousands of different BIRRP processes at once on Raijin. This same concept could be applied to running 2D inversions with OCCAM2D and Mod2DMT where one could run thousands of inversions in parallel by requesting the appropriate number of CPUs.

Installing and using MTpy on the VDI
-------------------------------------
:blue:`MTpy: A Python Toolbox for Magnetotelluric (MT) Data Processing, Analysis, Modelling and Visualization`

Written in Python, the code is open source, containing sub-packages and modules for various tasks within the standard MT data processing and handling scheme. For more information on MTpy, please read:

`Krieger and Peacock 2014`_. MTpy: A Python toolbox for magnetotellurics. Computers & Geosciences, 72, 167-175.

.. _Krieger and Peacock 2014: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300414001794

We will now go through the installation of two versions of MTpy on the VDI:

**V1:** https://github.com/geophysics/mtpy

This is the original version of MTpy. The advantage of this version is it has few dependencies making it easy to install and use. This version will take up approximately 115MB of disk space.

::

    $ cd ~/

    $ git clone https://github.com/geophysics/mtpy.git

    $ cd mtpy

    $ python setup.py install


To test that mtpy has been installed::

    $ module load python/2.7.11

    $ module load ipython/4.2.0-py2.7

    $ ipython

.. code-block:: python

    In [1]: from mtpy import utils


If this line of python code works then you have successfully installed MTpy on the VDI!

Now let's try an example of converting BIRRP outputs to edi files. For this, we will work with an example BIRRP output found here::

  /g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/2M/M1/

Note that the BIRRP config file is **CP1.script** and the survey_configfile is **survey.cfg**.


Let's head back to our ipython terminal

.. code-block:: python

  In [2] from mtpy.processing.birrp import convert2edi
  In [3] stationname = 'c01'
  In [4] survey_configfile = '/g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/2M/M1/survey.cfg'
  In [5] in_dir = '/g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/2M/M1/'
  In [6] birrp_configfile = '/g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/2M/M1/CP1.script'
  In [7] convert2edi(stationname, in_dir, survey_configfile, birrp_configfile, out_dir = None)

This should create the following edi file::

  /g/data/my80/sandbox/capricorn_test/loop_test/2M/M1/C01.edi


**V2:** https://github.com/MTgeophysics/mtpy

This is the most up to date version of MTpy and will take up approximately 370MB of disk space. Additionally, a virtual environment needs to be created in order to install some of the dependencies, which will take up approximately 190 MB of disk space. This version of MTpy requires the following dependencies:

  * matplotlib>=2.02
  * numpy
  * PyYAML>=3.11
  * (geo)pandas
  * scipy
  * pillow
  * pyqt
  * qtpy
  * obspy
  * netcdf4
  * numpydoc>=0.7.0

To install::

  $ cd ~/

  $ git clone https://github.com/MTgeophysics/mtpy.git

Now we need to load in the required modules::

  $ module load python/2.7.11

  $ module load python/2.7.11-matplotlib

  $ module load numpy/1.11.1-py2.7

  $ module load scipy/0.17.1-py2.7

  $ module load ipython/4.2.0-py2.7

  $ module load pandas/0.18.1-py2.7

  $ module load netcdf4-python/1.2.4-ncdf-4.3.3.1-py2.7

  $ module load gdal/2.0.0

  $ module load virtualenv/15.0.2-py2.7

  and create a virtual environment::

    $ virtualenv mtpy_venv

    $ source mtpy_venv/bin/activate


Once the virtual environment has been activated, the following modules need to be installed via pip::

    $ pip install pyyaml

    $ pip install Pillow

    $ pip install qtpy

    $ pip install obspy

    $ pip install numpydoc==0.7.0


Now we can install mtpy::

    $ cd mtpy

    $ python setup.py develop


To verify the install::

    $ pip list | grep mtpy


To test, open up an ipython terminal:

.. code-block:: python

  In [1]: import mtpy.processing.birrp as birrp

If this works then MTpy has been successfully installed.

ModEM 3D inversions
--------------------
:blue:`Modular EM (ModEM) is a flexible electromagnetic modelling and inversion program written in Fortran 95.`

It is currently available to use with 2D and 3D MT problems. For more information about ModEM, please read:

Kelbert, A., Meqbel, N., Egbert, G.D. and Tandon, K., 2014. ModEM: A modular system for inversion of electromagnetic geophysical data. Computers & Geosciences, 66, pp.40-53. - `Kelbert et al. link`_

Egbert, G.D. and Kelbert, A., 2012. Computational recipes for electromagnetic inverse problems. Geophysical Journal International, 189(1), pp.251-267. - `Egbert and Kelbert link`_

.. _Kelbert et al. link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300414000211

.. _Egbert and Kelbert link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2011.05347.x

Let's test the serial and parallel **Mod3DMT** codes on the VDI and Raijin for the *ObliqueOne Inversion* dataset given in the *examples* folder of the ModEM software.

**Test 1: Serial Mod3dMT on the VDI**

::

  $ cd /g/data/my80/sandbox/modem_test/ObliqueOne/INV/

  $ module load modem

  $ mod3DMT -I NLCG  50_2x2_for_ObliqueOne.model Z_10_5_16p_100st_ObliqueOne_Noise50.data Inv_para.dat FWD_para.dat x02_y02_z02.cov

  or

  $ source my_script

The job execution time for this script was 1180m29s (almost 20 hours).

**Test 2: Parallel Mod3dMT_MPI on Raijin**

In order to use the Mod3DMT_MPI code, you will have join the group ModEM-geophys via NCI's `mancini`_\ page. Once you have been granted access to this group::

    $ cd /g/data/my80/sandbox/modem_test/ObliqueOne/INV3/

To run Mod3dMT_MPI, we need to create a shell script. For this example, let's use the normal cue, 32 cups, 4GB memory and a walltime of 10 minutes::

  #!/bin/bash

  #PBS -P <project code>
  #PBS -q normal
  #PBS -l walltime=0:10:00,mem=4GB,ncpus=32,jobfs=100MB
  #PBS -l wd

  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2

  module load openmpi/1.10.2
  module load intel-mkl/15.0.3.187
  module load ModEM-geophysics/2013.06

  mpirun -np 16 --map-by slot:PE=$OMP_NUM_THREADS /apps/ModEM-geophysics/2013.06/bin/Mod3DMT_MPI -I NLCG 50_2x2_for_ObliqueOne.model Z_10_5_16p_100st_ObliqueOne_Noise50.data Inv_para.dat FWD_para.dat x02_y02_z02.cov -v debug -P './tmpvec' > mod3dmt_oblique_test.out.$PBS_JOBID

To run this shell script::

  $ qsub < mod3dmt_shell_script >


Experiment with some of the following commands to monitor the progress of this job::

  $ qstat -u $USER

  $ qstat -sw <jobID>

  $ qstat -E <jobID1,...>

  $ qstat -f <jobID>

  $ qcat -s <jobID>

  $ qcat -e <jobID>

  $ qcat -o <jobID>

  $ qls <jobID>

  $ qcp <jobID>/* ./

  $ qps <jobID>

  $ nqstat_anu <jobID>

Once this job is complete, to see the stats::

  $ qstat -u $USER -x

  $ qstat -sw <jobID> -x

  $ qstat -fx <jobID>

Additionally, 8 hours after the job is complete, the job stats should be available `here`__

__ https://usersupport.nci.org.au/report/job_history

The job execution time for this script was 7m51s. For this example, using Mod3DMT_MPI on Raijin produces results almost 170 times faster than using the serial Mod3DMT on the VDI.
